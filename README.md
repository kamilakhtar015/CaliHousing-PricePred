# 🏘️ California Housing Price Prediction

This project is a complete end-to-end Machine Learning solution for predicting housing prices in California. It is based on the first hands-on project from the book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the median house value for California districts, given a number of features describing those districts.

The ML workflow includes:

1. 🧠 Understanding the problem  
2. 📥 Data collection and loading  
3. 📊 Data visualization and exploration  
4. 🧹 Data preparation and transformation  
5. 🏗️ Model selection and training  
6. 🔍 Hyperparameter tuning  
7. 📈 Performance evaluation  
8. 🚀 Preparing the solution for deployment

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is a modified version of the California housing data from the 1990 U.S. Census. It includes:

- Geographic data (longitude, latitude)
- Socio-economic features (e.g., median income, housing age)
- Target variable: Median house value

## 💡 Key Learnings

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling missing values and categorical attributes
- Feature scaling and transformation pipelines
- Model evaluation using cross-validation
- Grid search for hyperparameter tuning
